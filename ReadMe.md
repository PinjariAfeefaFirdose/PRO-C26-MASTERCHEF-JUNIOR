ingridiants to make paratta.
1. Atta (dough made of flour and water)
2. Flour
3. Oil
4. Flat surface
5. Belan (rolling pin)
6. Tawa (frying pan)

making paratta.
1. Place the dough on a flat clean surface and roll your hands over it till it gets the shape of a thick rod.
2. Break off chunks of the dough forming smaller balls of dough.
3. Roll the uneven balls between your hands till they form rounder balls and then cover them in flour.
4. Place these balls on a flat surface and flatten them a little.
5. Using a rolling pin, flatten the ball, then turn it a bit and flatten it some more till you get a circular shape that's not too thin. It shouldn't tear very easily.
6. Spread some oil over the surface and fold the circle in half.
7. Spread some more oil over this surface and fold it in half again.
8. Cover this quarter circle with flour and then flatten it with a rolling pin again.
The folding creates layers that are the essence of a paratha.
Repeat this step if you want more layers.
9. Heat a tawa or frying pan and place your flattened dough on it and spread some oil over it.
10. Cook both sides till it turns golden brown with a darker brown pattern on it.
